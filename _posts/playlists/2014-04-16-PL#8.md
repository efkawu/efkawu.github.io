And here it comes... this set is a bit darker and heavier than the previous one. 
Years ago one of my best friend decided to introduce me to the metal genre. 
Unfortunately my ears were too weak to glimpse all the variety of heavy sounds 
so we stopped at doom metal. Slower tempo, low-tuned guitars and the depths of 
despair in lyrics suited me more. We used to spend many evenings on listening, 
sharing and discussing songs. That was an unforgettable trip. 
Here I want to share a piece of it with you. 

Enjoy.
