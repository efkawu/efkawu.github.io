So How Does It Feel?

I just had an urge to create this playlist as soon as I heard the first seconds of "Winter Kills" by Yazoo. 
It just blew my mind out and I couldn't refuse to prepare a bit emotional set this time. 
My new discovery - Half Moon Run - and their album "Dark Eyes" from 2012 has been one of my favourites. 
Akua Naru and india.arie with their soul music, and an acoustic bent sings from the heart 
and - believe me - you can truly feel it on your skin. The most surprising song was "Two men in Love" by The Irrepressibles 
- one of the most terrific pieces of sound recently. I'm sure I don't have to introduce Fever Ray. 
She usually creates an icy electronic atmospheres that perfectly wraps this set up.

So sit comfortably and enjoy it.
